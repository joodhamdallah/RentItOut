## External APIs Usedüìå
- OpenRouteService API: The platform utilizes the OpenRouteService API to calculate accurate delivery costs for rented items. When a customer selects the delivery option, the API calculates the driving distance between the pickup location (specified by the platform or vendor) and the customer‚Äôs address. This distance-based calculation determines the shipping cost, which is added to the customer‚Äôs bill.
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim API: This API is used for geocoding addresses, converting the customer's inputted address and the platform‚Äôs pickup location into geographic coordinates. These coordinates allow the platform to determine the distance between locations, essential for calculating logistics costs accurately.

## External Libraries and Packages üì¶

- mysql2: Connects to the MySQL database and manages data transactions within the platform.

- @faker-js/faker: Generates fake data for testing, such as usernames, emails, and addresses, to help with seeding the database.

- bcrypt: Encrypts user passwords by hashing them, ensuring they are stored securely.

- crypto: Generates secure, hashed tokens, particularly for password reset functions. For example, tokens are hashed when generating password reset links.

- jsonwebtoken (jwt): Creates JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication and role-based access control.

- express: The core framework for building the server and handling routes, middleware, and HTTP requests.

- cookie-parser: Parses cookies in HTTP requests. In this project, it handles token management, especially for cookies storing authentication tokens.

- express-session: Manages user sessions, particularly for features like the cart, by storing session data on the server.

- node-cron: Schedules automated tasks. In this project, it‚Äôs used to schedule daily email reminders for users, ensuring timely return of rented items.

- axios: Facilitates HTTP requests to external APIs, such as the OpenRouteService and Nominatim APIs, used for calculating delivery distances and geocoding addresses.

- moment: Formats dates and times, useful for billing dates, rental return dates, and other time-sensitive data.

- geolib: Calculates geographic distances between locations, helping with shipping cost calculations for deliveries.

- puppeteer: Generates PDFs, such as invoices for rentals, using custom HTML and CSS for formatting.

- nodemailer: Sends emails, including password reset links and rental invoices, to keep users informed.

   ```bash
   cd RentitOut
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

4. To set up the database:
- Our platform manages data efficiently by using separate scripts for creating, seeding, and deleting database tables. These scripts are located in the config directory and make setting up the database straightforward.
  1. Navigate to the config directory:
   ```bash
   cd config
   ```
  2. Create the tables and the relations between them
   ```bash
    node migrate.js
   ```
  3. Insert fake data into tables:
   ```bash
     node seed.js
   ```
  4. If you want to delete the tables:
   ```bash
    node dropTables.js 
   ```
   5. If you want to delete the records of tables but keep the tables:
   ```bash
    node clearRecords.js 
   ```

5. Set up .env: Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` using the following command:
   ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
  - DB_HOST=localhost         
  - DB_USER=root
